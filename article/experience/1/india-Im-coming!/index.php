    I had been reading quite an impressive amount of lifestyle blogs where rebellious and brave women got to leave their insipid jobs and their stupid boyfriends, they moved to Sri Lanka, Turkey, Bali or even Space and forgot about shaving the most unreachable private parts once and for all. I read, read, read and thought: "That is not me, I cannot do it, I don't even know what my breakfast will look like or will I shower this evening… I have no answers for my routine, how, God,  HOW will I ever know where to transfer myself both physically and mentally".<br><br>

    Honestly, I'd never had a dream to travel and I'd never been obsessed with any particular foreign culture. I loved my cozy (scratched) leather sofa and my huge plant that covered most of my studying table. The bloody leaves were always tickling my face when I worked on my laptop so I had to move the poor plant to the other side of the room. But I still loved it, kinda? I was too attached to my dog and my job. I was in my privileged comfort zone. <br><br>

    It’s not phenomenal when one decides to leave the routine in the worst moments of life.<br><br>

    I worked at one of the “major players” media companies that had all the spotlight and glamour. A pretty safe boat you might think… unfortunately, that “worst moment” had come and I got fired… for a year. “Short-termed Redundancy” my boss kept repeating. If you ever worked in the office environment, you would be smirking at the word “redundancy”. There’s no such thing. If a company decides to get rid of you it means that you weren’t skilled enough to keep up your position.

    But I’d known for sure I was skilled enough  - I was always glorified over my colleagues for the hard work and selfless determination. When I asked to explain my temporary sacking, ostensibly the absence of bold decisions became a problem. I was told to return in one year with a “prodigious experience behind your back”. Surely, I could foresee the storm by paying attention to office applauds to new-returners from a Bali sabbatical. Creative department worshiped the campaigns that were inspired by around-the-world adventures. As soon as my colleague returned home from a holiday in South Africa, our office arranged a party with her face on the cake!

That evening, I needed some empowering advice that’s why I chose Natalie, a friend from my facebook feed who was reminding me of Jessa from Girls in the most uncanny way. Entering her bohemian and eccentric apartment I felt that this girl was not going to take my side and, most likely, would tell me to unleash my neurosis and do something spontaneous.<br><br>

“Explore your womanhood” were the first words she poured to me after the long boring hour of my complaints and cry-outs. As a woman, who hadn’t worn a bra for nearly a year, my first instinct was to freak out. If I was told to face my inner self, I’d just read a bunch of books, visit a few museums, take a spa holiday in suburbs and probably get wasted in the evening. That’s me. Does it count as womanhood? Hell yeah.<br><br>

There was only one person who could answer all the questions about womanhood, job problems and my future. My mother is a very generous and altruistic person. Her career is basically based on being a giver. During my whole life, there’s never been a moment of coldness: she’s been there for me no matter what. Once, I broke up with my boyfriend of three days, and she spent the whole night listening that he was the one. After such a torturous night, she didn’t even take a day off work. She is very, very strong. That is why in my newcame moment of weakness I decided to interrogate this loving person with my dumb problems - mom, what should I do? Why am I not like you?<br><br>
</p>


<p>
  To my surprise (not to yours), my typically affectionate mother turned into a tired and exhausted old person. She strongly agreed that I needed to kick up my butt. I had always thought that your parents were the only people you could come to, complain to and in the end, never be judged. Funny enough, I was never 100% honest with my parents - I shared only favourable parts of the truth so that they would take my side and agree with me. In this situation, it didn’t work out well.<br><br>

  My mom is an anthropologist and she works abroad quite frequently. In one year, she visits around ten countries, sometimes even more! That’s why it wasn’t one of her insane ideas to send me out to India. Apparently, one of her co-workers couldn’t commit to the secondment in Delhi and she needed to find a substitute urgently. When my mom insisted that I must use this unique opportunity, please don’t judge me my reader, I started to imagine slums and crowds and intense smells of herbs and spices. All those stereotypical images jumped in my head, I didn’t even hear the rest of my mother’s monologue… I was too busy freaking out that I would never fit in. I knew that many people used such opportunities for “self-exploration”, many used it simply to “help” local communities. They returned to their homes and had wonderful slash inspirational stories to share. I looked at my life and realised that I would never be this person - I would be simply mocked for trying.<br><br>


  Of course, I was curious. Of course, it was tempting.<br><br>

  One week later, I was standing in the check-in queue trying to find a decent reason to back out. “Mom, you have to find someone else, I’ve just met my ex and we decided to get together!” or “Mom, I’m going home, I forgot my Zadie Smith book, this is simply a sign” or “Mom, bah-bye, nice try, I give up”. “Mom, I can’t do this” was the most realistic choice to take.<br><br>

  I’ve never met a person who handles 15 hours flight with grace and elegance. I looked and felt like someone poured olive oil all over my face and my body. At the same time, I got the ominous fear that had suffused with suspicious strength. I used to have it in my biology class when a headteacher was scrolling through a list of students to choose a victim to interrogate with the meticulous questions about schizogony. <br><br>

  Henceforth, everything seemed to be a vivid hallucination. I wasn’t anxious about the crowds or hectic speed of border inspections. Neither I was alerted that there was no board with my name printed on A4. I just couldn’t believe it: I’m miles and miles away from home, all by myself. After two hours of my almost acid experience, it became quite obvious that no one is meeting me. My phone doesn’t work either.
 <br><br>

 Then the events turned into chaotic wheel of constant fiascos. Being naive and helpless, I got a half-working cab with an excited and friendly driver who didn’t have a clue where my hotel was. After three hours (!!!) of expensive driving, I was lost in the city with the remaining 30% of my money. I didn’t have energy or strength to be annoyed. I was standing in the middle of the street thinking “why the fuck did I come here?”. Simultaneously, I was lucky enough to be approached and trusted by an Indian family that invited me to their house and provided a mattress to crush on.
<br><br>

  My mother never booked a hotel for me. She didn’t book the transfer from the airport too. I was wildly misguided by my whimsical mother who thought I needed to “wake up”. Well, I had never been more awake on the moist mattress full of black mould, mom.
  <br><br>

  Weeks went by and I started to question whether I had a spiritual aspiration or any sort of epiphany. In reality, I was the same person with the same pet peeves with the same disgusted face when I saw a monkey poo. I came here hoping to become Julia Roberts, but life is not a movie with Javier Bardem. It takes longer time and harder effort to fully observe the new culture, adapt to it and finally, get attached. You must be an alien for quite a while. </p>

    After some time, my colleague Siya and I became very friendly. She was a lovely, modest lady with the surprising amount of energy after the ten hour shift. She looked so shy and so small, you’d be scared that wind might take her away. But boy she’s good at her job! She managed to finish all documentations, all translations, all check ups that were given for a weekly assignment in just one day. I’d noticed that such spirit was well-maintained at our school: most teachers and staff were incredibly quick and efficient, with energy of the road-runner. <br><br>

    One weekend, Siya invited me to her parents’ house. We shared a delightful meal and our personal stories. I might sound too millennium, but it was surreal to sit with someone without TV, without films, without technology but to talk in its original meaning. As a comfortable Western citizen, I thought about my cravings for the late-night dosages of facebook . Like a heroin addict, I felt the blood-sucking urge to check out random things I’m not interested in. Did my sister-in-law finish her dissertation? What’s Beyonce up to? What Disney Princess am I in the buzzfeed quiz? Such thoughts were rapidly disappearing with time, but I was shocked how mainstream entertainment had impacted my daily life.<br><br>

    When I asked how can one achieve a state of harmony with inner self, Siya’s parents told me that I ask too many questions in lieu of living in one moment. For some reason, I felt incredibly guilty. Not that I overanalysed my thoughts... but can you imagine how many the whitest of the white people come over here and like me are trying to find themselves frantically? How many people come here for the ten months and concentrate on their life and their harmony and their adventure? It is so common and so normal for us but at the same time it seems so bizarre if you try to slow down and observe.<br><br>

Since that day, I tried not to think about the consequences of my trip. I was working extremely hard for the remaining eight months and eventually adjusted into my new pace. It’s vital to keep yourself busy by attending the most vibrant and fascinating weddings, learning the recipes of strong-flavored chutneys and exploring the beauty of Indian temples. Howbeit, it would be impossible to fit in without the passionate determination to work.
<br><br>

I came to India hoping for this trip to end on the very first day. Without an opportunity to back off, I impatiently awaited to wake up with an updated soul version. However, focusing on the process, not result, had played the major role in my journey. In the end, by doing your job you help others and it is the only valuable reward you can get. I cannot comment whether my values transcended into an ameliorable set of beliefs or principles… I just have to wait and see.
<br><br>

Arriving, I had so many questions about myself and my future, I was certain that one trip would be invigorating for my spirit - well, reader, I still have those questions. One trip, even if it lasts for ten months, is not going to change your life. Though, without doubts, it will strengthen and nourish your merits.</p>

  You will notice your little “roaches”. Writing this article, I cringed and I cringed and I cringed. However, I learnt one thing - I must be honest with myself. I must see and accept what I said, what I felt, what I feared. In the end, I proved myself wrong. I proved that the comfort living was not fulfilling, in reality, it was shallow and privileged and way, way, way too serious.
<br><br>

  It’s important to note that being so far away from your home does feel amazing, like an admirable achievement. In our hectic, almost unstoppable social life, it’s not emotionally stimulating to participate in activities that you have no interest in. There’s almost no time to experiment (your new green dye doesn’t count)! I was stuck with my phones, my bars, my friends and my very much loved interests. I nourished my routine and eventually it overlapped any potential excitement to try something new. Thank you, mom, for lying and tricking me into this striking peregrination.<br><br> </p>


<p>
  Perhaps, I could sum up my experience in a shorter form. Perhaps, I could write some general tips for the trip to India. But I chose to share my imperfect story about a hilariously demanding escapade… and learn from it.
