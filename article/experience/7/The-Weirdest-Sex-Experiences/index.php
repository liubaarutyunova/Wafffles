      “Please, never share this story with anybody” were the very first words my mum could find after listening to one of the most distressing experiences I had to go through. As a woman, and as a woman in the 21st century, I am not ashamed to say that I love sex. Moreover, I do not feel any shame (nobody should) that I have sex regularly even at times when my partners are...irregular. Throughout my 20s I dated a dozen of guys, some of them were kind and sensitive and respectful, and some of them weren’t. However, I’m not going to share anything about either of these types.
    </p>
    <p>This article will share something much more intriguing. Weird sex stories. Disturbing things that I was asked to do with “normal” looking people. I knew that my personal experience wouldn’t gather as much outrage as I wanted to, hence, I met up with my girlfriends over wine and we started talking...

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Draw a heart on my chest</h1>

    <p> Let’s start with a classic. I met a guy on Tinder and we had a fantastic day. We walked around Shoreditch, got some nice gloves in the vintage shop nearby. The dinner talk was effortlessly pleasant. We shared intensely sexual looks. I wanted him. Coming to his flat, I couldn’t wait any longer, we started sharing passionate kisses and it was about to happen. But...he suddenly ran off and got back with a knife. Firstly, I had a thought “this is exactly how women get killed” but I couldn’t continue the monologue in my head. He was sitting right in front of me. “I want to make love to you. But you need to cut my chest, draw hearts on my chest”. I kissed him passionately but instead of having sex, we stayed up all night talking.</p>

     <h1 class="articleActual_point">Leg</h1>

         <img src="../img/2.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
       </div>
     </div>

    <p>This one is particularly odd. Before the climax, the boy I was shagging asked if he could end on...my leg. That’s it.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Let’s wait for my parents</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">

    </div>

    <p>After the cinema, we went to my boyfriend’s house. I was quite excited as we decided to keep things slowly and “it was the night”. As things started to heat up, he stopped me and asked if we could wait for his parents to return home. In his view, sex is much more exciting when the risk of getting exposed is rather apparent.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Can we look in the mirror?</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">

    </div>


    <p>Just like in the American Psycho, I was asked to follow our act by looking in the mirror. To some, it isn’t a big deal but I am celebrating every second that I manage to keep my eyes on the mirror. Asking me to look at my n a k e d self wasn’t simply outrageous, it was mad. I had never as fast as I did that night.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Bellybuttons are important! Apparently..</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">
      <div class="imgWithoutQuote">
        <img src="../img/5.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Licking bellybuttons should be illegal.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Maple syrup will never be the same</h1>

    </div>

    <p>It was January. Post-holiday depression. Tinder was my only way to survive. After the numerous odd dates, I finally got along with the man who looked like Paul Rudd. “Sweet” - I thought of him. How ironic. Once we decided to sleep together, he went into the kitchen and quickly returned with the huge bottle of maple syrup. He was naked. He poured quite a generous amount on his penis and asked if I could lick it all. What we did or what we didn’t do isn’t important...</p>


    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Hold me like a baby</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">
      <div class="imgWithoutQuote">
        <img src="../img/7.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I’m not sure if it’s Freudian, but I met a guy with serious mother issues. We had a great night together, sex was amazing and he seemed to be a confident young man. Yet, it wasn’t a long time until he looked at me and asked me to hold him in my arms. “Let’s pretend I’m a baby”, he whispered. I was quite relieved I didn’t have to breastfeed him.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Orgasm a-la Japanese style</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">
      <div class="imgWithoutQuote">
        <img src="../img/8.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Alright, this guy was simply a dick. We didn’t talk much hence I had no means to detect his faults. At night, I was about to come, but then I got interrupted by him screaming random Japanese words (I am Japanese, he was American) in the very “anime” style.</p>


    <h1 class="articleActual_point">“Let’s shag and watch Star Wars ...simultaneously”</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">
      <div class="imgWithoutQuote">
        <img src="../img/9.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Meh, I thought it was as weird as it was cool.</p>

    <h1 class="articleActual_point">Let’s order some food...</h1>

    <div class="notWideImgDiv">
      <div class="imgWithoutQuote">
        <img src="../img/10.gif" class="notWideImgExpA3">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>I’m still traumatised by this man. We were at my place and we ordered too much food (junk food!), because he was really hungry and he wanted to stay up all night. I didn’t expect him to say that he wants to observe me eating. You know, in the moment when he’d touch himself. Chucked the guy out, kept the food. Winning.
