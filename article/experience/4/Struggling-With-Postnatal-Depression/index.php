    Do you not love your baby? Do you not want your baby? These are questions every parent going through postnatal depression may face. They are the hardest questions to hear and let alone answer. On top of symptoms like constant sadness, trouble sleeping or over-tiredness, mood-swings, and difficulties bonding with your baby, these questions are the last thing you want to hear.<br><br>

    Postnatal Depression is an illness no one can ever prepare for. Being 18 at the time, I was in an unhappy relationship - which, obviously, didn't create the best scenario to welcome a baby in to. I can say that my partner was definitely more thrilled than I was when the test said 'positive.' Five days after the pregnancy test, I developed 'morning sickness' - which is incredibly misleading for an unprepared, inexperienced 18 year old. It can hit you out of nowhere, anytime and anyplace. This led to me suffering a very long, very difficult pregnancy with a case of Hyperemesis Gravidarum, a complication in pregnancy causing severe vomiting and dehydration. Extreme dehydration and rapid weight loss led to spending significant time in hospital and on anti-sickness medication.<br><br>

    I had all the support my immediate family could physically provide during my pregnancy. My partner was at work full-time, putting a lot of hours not only for the money to support us, but if I’m honest, I think he didn't want to be around me when I was miserable. It meant that I spent a lot of my pregnancy time alone on the sofa with a sick bucket. Unable to eat or keep any fluids down, it was a very dangerous and stressful time. I was isolated and I couldn't socialize or step foot out of my house without having to be sick (which isn't ideal in public places). <br><br>

    When it was time to go into labour, fear and anxiety had already been clouding my brain for weeks. I was questioning myself whether I made a mistake, whether it was a good idea that i'd kept the baby...Of course, there was no going back. The momentous occasion had arrived. On the 10th October at 2am, 8 days later than my expected due date, I was awoken by an intense tightening pain in my stomach, like something was trying to claw its way outwards. After a painful and complicated 34 hours, I finally delivered my baby.<br><br>

    The majority of new parents’ reactions are obvious - they're ecstatic and ready to start their new journey as parents. Not me. The first thought I had when I saw my baby was “Oh my god, what have I done.” This small person was going to depend on me for the rest of its life and I wasn't even sure I could look after myself.<br><br>

    After the period of copious amounts of one-time visitors and after my partner’s paternity leave ended, I realised it all began to sink in. I hadn't slept a full night in two weeks - and every parent loved to remind me that there was “years of sleepless nights to come”. I was so utterly disturbed at the thought of being left on my own with this baby that just cries. All she did was cry. I was tired, it was difficult to sleep at night and I couldn't sleep during the day.The remaining (little) time my daughter did sleep, I spent tidying and cleaning everything around her. <br><br>

    This spiraled out of control very quickly. After laying awake at night, staring out of the window, I was eventually falling asleep from the pure exhaustion. But then, I was awoken by that cry. The cry that made my skin crawl and made me want to explode from the inside out. In one instance, my daughter was sitting in her bouncy chair and had been crying non-stop for at least 3 hours, I was absolutely beside myself and just didn't know what to do. I had fed, winded, changed and cuddled her and this just wasn't enough. <br><br>

    Sobbing at a baby to “please shut up because I can't handle it anymore” doesn't work, and it started to confirm my beliefs that I just couldn't do this and I would always be the worst parent in the world. She didn't love me and I wasn't the person who could make her happy, clearly. Some nights I was so exhausted I didn't even hear her cry, I wouldn't even wake up. <br><br>

    The beginning of my day would consist of my partner calling me lazy and criticizing me for this exhaustion, although, i'm not sure he understood what was happening. I also believed I was lazy. I felt humiliated and degraded at this point. I started questioning my own “good” - was I a good person? This lazy mother who hasn't even got the motivation to fix her life for her own child, or herself. I was afraid to tell anyone about these arguments in fear they would take my partner’s side (or my anxious side) and also brand me a lazy parent. I didn't want anyone to know what was happening in both real life and inside my head.<br><br>

    Arguments began to happen every morning as soon as I woke up. I would be groggy and exhausted only to be verbally abused. This sparked a rage inside me that I couldn't control, I would lash out towards my partner, throw things and scream uncontrollably. It was as if this rage from inside was controlling me, like I had a conflicting conscience, one stronger side that was telling me to let out all the anger I had bottled up. Yet I had another weaker side that told me me it was wrong and I needed help. <br><br>

    I can distinctly recall kicking the spindles out of the banister in a state of fury and using it to 'protect' myself. I wasn't being physically targeted but I can remember his words hitting me like knives as good as real blows would have. I remember holding up this bit of wood and screaming for him to stop or I would use it and I meant it.<br><br>

    After the daily morning arguments, I would be left in a state of vulnerability. I felt like my skin was film wrapped around my body, creating a trap. My mind was so overpowered with the anguish but, with no explanation why, I would have rather been sucked into a big black hole of nothingness.<br><br>

    I would sit in one place for hours with no energy to move or do anything, not to mention the fact I hadn't left the house since our first outing as a family. At worst, putting sentences together in my head was inconceivable. The overwhelming wave of negative emotion prevented any sort of rational or logical thought process. All I did was sit and cry. Sitting on the floor next to this perfect child, and crying about how I didn't want her - it has to be one of the most helpless feelings in the world.<br><br>

    Although the constant arguments created an unbearable tension in the house, my daughter was becoming happier, more interested in the world and more interactive. She was growing and developing skills at a normal rate, oblivious to what I was going through right in front of her. In turn, this caused me to become less involved and less interested. I would look at her and feel painfully guilty that I couldn't fix myself for her and that I didn't have the energy or motivation to take her out - to meet other babies or to simply have fun. She would sit in front of the tv and play on her own - she became very good at entertaining herself.<br><br>

    I would find myself waiting for the clock to strike 1pm as I knew that my mum had finished work. I'd ring her every day and ask her to have the baby, as I wanted to 'sleep.' When in reality I would just spend this time thinking about my life that was in shambles and out of my own control.<br><br>

    In the result, my mum would have the baby half of the week and the other half I would spend asking my mum to have her for “just a couple of hours”. Looking back, I think I couldn’t have this responsibility anymore, but my maternal instinct would make me miss her when she wasn't with me, like a magnet pulling her back to me. Unfortunately, she would come back again and the magnet would repel - the vicious cycle would continue.<br><br>

    As someone who suffers from clinical depression, this feeling of despair was way too familiar. The blurry days turned into blurry weeks. I didn't fully understand what was going on or why I felt this way until the words 'postnatal depression' got mentioned by my mum.<br><br>

    Immediate denial. I would not accept that this stigmatized illness had overtaken my life. I thought postnatal depression happened to people who want to abandon their babies to strangers. To mothers who don't love their own child. I didn't want to dump her on someone's door step nor did I “not love” her, so how could I possibly have postnatal depression? It felt I was gaining a label, as it was  a three word definition of my whole life. I thought I would be known as the woman who didn't want to step up to her responsibilities.<br><br>

    The last thing anyone ever wants to ever admit, not even to themselves, is not wanting their child anymore. I did not want to be a parent. I did not want to be depended on. I did not want to exist. How could I feel this way? I still don't know how I admitted to myself that I didn't want my baby anymore. Everyday I felt more and more like a failed human and lived with the thoughts that my baby would be better off without me. The conflicting conscience was still torturing my brain, one side telling me she needed me for the rest of her life and the other telling me she would have a better life without me.<br><br>

    When I became scared of my own thoughts, I started to realise it wasn't normal. I confided in my mum that the help was needed. She had been telling me to speak to my GP for a while but denial made that impossible. I finally got the courage to call and speak to my GP. The support I received from the doctor wasn't particularly attentive. They were very busy and did not have lot of time to make everyone a priority. As I couldn't bring myself to attend an appointment I had a phone assessment.<br><br>
    I assumed that my doctor would insist on attending a check up before prescribing any medications. However, the telephone assessment included a few standard questions - “do you feel persistently sad?” and “are you lethargic?” and I was immediately diagnosed with the postnatal depression. The GP prescribed me Citalopram, a type of antidepressant known as an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.) I reluctantly began taking them. Being on the anti-depressants for a long time during my teenage years, I was very aware of the side effects that I experienced personally - some medications exacerbated every negative emotion, leading to self harm and suicidal thoughts whereas some completely numbed all emotions altogether. I became very resentful to the medications after these experiences.<br><br>

    I was stubborn and I stopped taking them. I was tortured by the thoughts that this illness will control my life, and taking the pills that numbed me completely was too much. Treatment can vary for different people. Some individuals receive the needed help and they can feel like themselves again. However, this doesnt apply to everyones situation. It is important to keep in mind that although experiences may be extremely similar, coping mechanisms and treatment are not. <br><br>

    I retracted back into my shell, my relationship with my child was non-existent, and the relationship with my partner began to collapse. The arguments and the sadness involved outweighed any good times we had. When my partner and I finally parted ways, I crumbled. My life had completely fallen apart in front of me and there was nothing I could do. My daughter was with my mum full-time, I struggled to get myself out of bed for anything but to use the toilet and to make peanut butter on toast. I wouldn't eat a full meal unless my best friend cooked for me, purely because I had no reason to cook. “Why should I cook for myself when I can live on peanut butter toast?”- I was asking myself whilst looking in the mirror wondering why I was just skin and bones.<br><br>

    Due to the break-up, I no longer had any source of income. I had to live and pay bills, otherwise I wouldn't have a house to lay in bed in. The choice was either to work miserably or be homeless. I contacted a friend who was a supervisor in a technology store and was looking for new staff. Having a job did help me as it provided a sense of independence and (at the same time) escapism which was refreshing. Like a type of therapy, I was comfortable there and it began to feel like a second home. I was happy for a year but only 4 days a week and 4 hours a day. It was enough for me. After I had been there a year I was told that my hours would be changing to 6 hours a day.<br><br>

    My weak and fragile body couldn't cope with standing and moving for this long. I would constantly vomit from exhaustion and I had to take time off sick. I was sick for two weeks and when I came back everything had changed. My manager and supervisor (who were amazingly understanding and supportive throughout this year) both left their jobs. This caused a domino effect and staff started to leave on a weekly basis. We were understaffed and stressed and as a result I couldn't face going to this place anymore. It was no longer my “escape” and it became clear I struggled to function in what would be considered 'normal' life. This is when I unfortunately had to leave my job as I couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br>


    I spent my evenings at my best friend’s house with a small group of friends. They were all intent on helping me to recover. I must say, spending time with them felt like an achievement. It felt like I had accomplished doing a normal human function! One friend took the time to walk me home, made sure I had everything I needed, made sure I ate, and then spent more time with me so that I wouldn’t feel lonely. This friendship slowly budded into a relationship. He was the only person at this time of the little self-belief that could make me feel like I was worth something - like an actual human being. When I began to open up about my feelings, it was obvious I met someone who could actively help me to overcome my struggles.<br><br>

    He stayed with me and my daughter and provided an extra helping hand. He was someone to turn to when the answer or the solution wasn't clear. Someone who got up with my daughter and I to help to do the morning routine. He took the time to tell me I was doing great, and that I could only get better. I realise I'm extremely lucky to have found someone who completely picked me up from the absolute rock bottom and continues to show support everyday. <br><br>

    It was obvious to outsiders that I could do this, everyone but me saw the potential. It took a long time to transition from someone who layed in bed everyday to a parent who is motivated, level-headed and most importantly a parent for a child to rely on. I'm not even sure i'm 100% there yet, self belief isn't something that comes easily.<br><br>

    I began setting goals such as getting out of bed by a certain time and making sure I had my daughter with me a certain amount of hours/days a week. The second goal was probably the most difficult part of it all. My daughter, being only 2 at the time, was going backwards and forwards from my house, to her nans, then to her dads and back again, which made her extremeley unsettled and confused. This made the guilt and the stress very hard to tolerate. Perseverance continued and a relationship and bond slowly started to form between us. I would notice small things like colours and numbers she knew (that I certainly hadn't taught her) and my interest began to grow. We wanted to spend time together as mother and daughter and the love she had for me was so clear. She didn't hold a grudge towards me for going through this traumatic time and that meant absolutely everything.<br><br>

    In hindsight, if I had the opportunity to change anything, I wouldn’t have remained silent. I wish I never held in my darkest thoughts because I thoroughly believe I would have been offered more attentive help - NHS mental health is so inundated with patients and the people who suffer in silence often go unnoticed. <br><br>

    I found solace in speaking with some women who have also suffered absolute heartache from the postnatal depression. It has become clear to me that there are real signs and situations that fit into most people’s experiences of postnatal depression.<br><br>

    One of the mothers, for instance, expressed her sudden realisation that something was wrong when she left her daughter to cry for quite a while until her neighbour knocked to check everything was okay.
    Another woman shared that she realised there was an issue as soon as her second child was born, and that she was so physically and emotionally drained that her mother urged her to seek professional help. It did sound awfully familiar. <br><br>

    As a new parent, it's difficult to decipher if you're tired from the night feeds or from the declining mental health. However, it is important to detect other signs and symptoms, for example, if you or another parent is not bonding with the baby. Other symptoms would include the reluctance to get involved with the baby, isolation from other people, rapid weight loss/gain or a change in eating habits, and, of course, persistent sadness.<br><br>

    Guilt is a very strong factor that often goes unnoticed. I will never stop feeling guilty for not being around for my child in her most important moments, for not stepping up to the plate and being the mother she deserved. This is something a lot of women with similar experiences also shared with me - they feel that they let their children down. It is important to know that this is something that you cannot predict or avoid, and no one should ever feel or be made to feel guilty for going through this.<br><br>

    Recovering is a long process, it takes time and patience to overcome something so life changing. I'm still not at the end of my journey yet. Some days I wake up and feel like I have reverted back to my old self, whereas other days I feel completely cured. Everyday is different but I try and make it work, whether I push myself to make up an activity with my daughter, or to spend time doing things I love. I refuse to go back.<br><br>

    I found that speaking to other parents is extremely helpful, even if they don't have postnatal depression, they can always relate to the parent-issues. Some people don't share their emotions with their partners or friends due to embarrassment or fear that they will be judged. It often seems that the sufferers’ own embarrassment and guilt prevents communication, however, by speaking openly and honestly, you will experience a helpful and warm-welcoming reception from others. I understand, it is extremely hard to tell people that you're struggling to do the most the basic human functions but, in the end, it could be the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself. <br><br>

    Sometimes it's not possible to talk to someone around you and it makes you think that you are on your own. Confiding to your GP can be extremely beneficial, they are here to help once you feel ready to share your struggles. As stated above, treatment depends on the individual, but the first part of the journey is finding what works best for you. There are many charities that dedicate their time to help sufferers of postnatal depression and offer the support when you most need it.<br><br>
