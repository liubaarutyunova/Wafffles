	<p>
		I talk about my experience very often despite that my memories are formed of sudden narratives. It’s funny because I see my past as a collection of stereotypical TV episodes. People used to ask me how I handled my experience so well. I didn’t know how to respond. I was deceived, but I feel relieved that I am free now.<br><br>

		I don’t like to think about my life before I joined the religious cult, though. I was a type A girl with the homework always done in time. I didn’t have many friends, in fact, I am not sure I spoke to anybody at school about my personal life. My family was very strict, very puritanical and boys couldn’t call me. I don’t think they wanted, anyway.<br><br>

		At times, I didn’t sleep at nights, I imagined my life to be dynamic and sociable. I imagined barbeque parties, a special table for gifts, a chocolate cake baked by my nana. I imagined it was my birthday. In my thoughts, all school was excited to celebrate my day with me. In my life, nobody knew when my birthday was.<br><br>

		Mornings after such dreams, I was usually very sleepy and didn’t perform at school. I just couldn’t be productive. Very occasionally, I brought home marks like B or C+ and was attacked by my mother. She screamed at me and called me useless. She wanted me to stop thinking about stupid things and sleep well at nights. She wanted me to be a robot without a life even when it was imaginary.<br><br>

		This is why it was so exciting to meet Robert. I never knew how to talk to a boy. Of course, it was the same as talking to my classmates about homework. But at the same time, it was overwhelming to be asked something as simple as what is my name.<br><br>


		That day, it was raining cats and dogs and my train was delayed. In romantic films, a stranger would appear with a bright umbrella that can fit two people. At the train station, a  stranger stood behind me without an umbrella, just like me. I still remember the touch of his hand on my shoulder. Then, my life turned into kaleidoscopic hallucination.</p>

			We were friends for a very long time. I was very attracted to Robert though. My mum was fond of him, too. As I never told her I met him at the train station, she believed that this well-mannered boy has a royal arts museum membership. He talked to my mother a lot and gained her trust. Although he had a very dualistic nature. A posh, intelligent art student and a rebel who taught me to smoke weed. I loved him.<br><br>

			I loved him when he introduced me to his community. I loved him when he screamed at me for missing a seminar with the community. I loved him when he demanded money for the community and I had to steal a credit card from my parents. I loved him when in a basement room we took acid and he asked me to watch the community members having sex. I was told to love <i>him and the community.</i><br><br>


			In the beginning, I thought it was the only form of love that exists. I didn’t know the gentle and forgiving kind of love, my parents were very tough with me. I thought I deserved to be yelled at. I took it as a sign of care. With time, I became discombobulated. I had to keep up the excellent academic performance at school and outstanding loyalty to the community. I didn’t have time to sleep because a lot of community meetings were changed to the later hours. It is crazy but I felt grateful for that.<br><br>

			I cannot say there were many drugs involved. From time to time, we loved to take acid to experience the spirituality and share it between the members. Weed wasn’t very welcomed, but Robert and I liked to have a joint once in awhile. There wasn’t a distinctive abundance of sex, too, we had a monthly ritual. It was very strict as consent mattered. But if you didn’t want to have sex, you were asked to watch.</p>

				There were eight people in our community. I was the last one to join. Robert told me that I had cute vulnerability that attracted him so much. I was very thankful that he chose me to join the community, as it felt like a unique opportunity to become emotionally stronger. Our seminars involved talks about the power of united egos which I didn’t understand thoroughly. Robert always laughed at me and called me “silly”. At this point of my life, the stockholm syndrome was on its peak.<br><br>

				Eventually, I realised that I needed to leave. Mentally, it wasn’t possible, I was too anxious and paranoid that nobody would ever love me again. I was blessed to have Robert in my life, at least, I felt I was. Three months later, I was suffering from exhaustion and abuse. My school marks lost the glory and my mother prohibited me to see Robert. He couldn’t accept it that is why we arranged my runaway.<br><br>


				Taking only toothbrush and a pair of tights, I wasn’t prepared to leave my house. I didn’t want to disappoint Robert but I also didn’t want to aggravate the relationships with my parents. He asked me whether I was okay, but I could never find the right answer. It was so simple - just yes or no. I never answered.<br><br>

				As we arrived, I was warmly welcomed by our members. It appeared that they prepared something special for this occasion. They said they were waiting for a very long time for me to move in. When I saw a full room of excited adults cheering my arrival, it resembled the dream about my birthday. Except for the fact that it brought a much darker sensation, an obscure worry or fear. Robert asked me if I was ready to “lay in bed with him”. He gently stroked my hair and insisted that I mustn’t give an answer straight away, that he would be waiting for me in the “room-A”. I looked at other members and they seemed to share the identical expression on their faces - they were smiling in a very disturbing kind of way.<br><br>

To avoid looking at other people, I went to a room-A with Robert. It took a lot of bravery to explain that I wasn’t comfortable anymore. I was scared and I wasn’t ready. I didn’t even understand where I was. I moaned that if he loved me, he would understand and reassure me. Instead he took me home and told me to forget the community.<br><br>

Next morning, I received a message with the instructions. I had to delete all mobile numbers and pictures, I had to throw all gifts and burn the receipts from seminars. I was told to remain silent otherwise the actions would be taken. To note that I was overwhelmed by the paranoia is an understatement.<br><br>

I tried to come back there - physically I was more than attached. Living a double life brought the adventurous spirit I had lacked before. The thought of upcoming perfection was terrifying. I didn’t want to return to A+, school activities, dreams about my popular birthdays. It seemed to be unfair to be taken away from this wicked, disturbing interest. I knew it was wrong but I wanted to make this decision myself, I wanted to wait to be ready to leave.</p>

	Apparently, the community moved their “headquarters” into the unknown space. I was looking for them for inappropriate amount of time. I didn’t study very well. I didn’t attend extracurricular activities. I didn’t dream about my birthday. The obsession blinded me and I  thougt I could never get my usual life back.<br><br>

	Five years later I became a successful criminology student. Now I tend to keep my past behind me. I managed to live without any psychological help because I talked to people. During the last semester of school, I had an opportunity to lead a talk about cult criminal groups. That was my first experience opening up. I shared my story with people and I wasn’t judged. I wasn’t laughed at.<br><br>

It’s important to understand that these experiences do not define us. It’s very hard to live in a place where everybody sees you as nothing but a victim. Since, I have faced a lot of confused reactions and mixed emotions from other people. I saw anger, I saw sadness, I saw amuse. Some people thought I would eventually collapse and offered professional help. Some people blamed me for my own problems - which I understand completely as I had blamed myself for a very long time. I never reacted because I think time cured me.</p>

	A few months ago, I met up with my mum. We hadn’t seen each other a lot since my high school graduation. She found out about who Robert was during my university speech. I invited her to listen because I couldn’t handle talking to her personally. I never blamed her for the pressure or for the stress I had in my life. But I was afraid that she would blame herself and I never wanted it for my mum.<br><br>

	During the meeting, my mum told me that Robert was arrested. She also told me that the police found out that the oldest member of the community was Robert’s mother. I think I laughed hysterically to my mum’s deadliest face. I didn’t know how else I could react. Horrible things happen to good people all the time. I’ve learnt that you can protest it, you can ignore it and you can face it, but in the end you will need help. In my situation, I grew the strength to cure my disease with communication and time.<br><br>

	I doubt that I will ever forget or forgive my past. I, instead, will challenge it and make it the least significant story of my life.
