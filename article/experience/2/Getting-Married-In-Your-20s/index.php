		Getting married is exhausting. The stress is maximising from the painstaking exam preparations that are distracted by your old-fashioned parents asking “Have you found THE dress yet?”. Or those shocked wedding shop assistants whispering “Gosh, is she 16? Is it even legal?”.<br><br>

		I’m not the type of person who cares about harsh criticism or judgement. You can burst with anger and hatred towards things that I do, I’ll imitate Robert Dw Jr eye rolls and leave. Unfortunately, getting married with my lover evoked an outbreak of some pretty nasty comments that I couldn’t ignore.<br><br>

		It’s easy to deal with your relatives. I’ve learnt to abstract from their repetitive monologues about my future when I was 15. Being a teenager wasn’t easy for me, or for anyone on this planet, as I had to face completely irrelevant questions about marriage, kids and, surprisingly, my vagina. I remember sitting in the kitchen, painting skulls in my notebook and listening to dreadful stories about some girl that started dating at my age. They referred to her as a “slut”.<br><br>

		How many times did I try to stand up and accuse these people to be inhumane misogynists? Quite a few times, oh yes. I can’t say I particularly enjoyed to be sent off to my room, but I was fuelled by excitement that I was doing a right thing. It was my own personal protest. Instead of breaking glass, I broke their sexist comments.<br><br>

		With time, I got exhausted. I changed my tactic to rational debates which didn’t last very long, too. Nowadays, I’m practising the isolating act of escapism. Whilst my relatives scream their guts out about their daughter who not only disappointed them but betrayed the worldwide principles of probity, I was in my own world of Patti Smith poetry and  Margarethe von Trotta films. Eventually, I would come out of my daydreaming phase and say something neutral yet sarcastic. Everyone is allowed to survive in their own way. If I kept arguing, if I kept talking to these people, I would end up imploding with my unabated fury.<p>

				Clearly, the notion of me getting married provoked a victory parade at my apartment. My relatives were laughing smugly that the demons I had were gone. “The right man will organise you”, - they said. To their happiness, I wasn’t 15 anymore and, taking a deep breath, I nodded and answered “I have always been organised by myself”. Actually, that evening involved a terrifying amount of nodding which leaded to muscular disfunction of my neck next day. <br><br>

				To marry a UK citizen also guaranteed a lot of nauseous comments about “getting out there”. Among my relatives, immigration generally enrages the unstoppable Donald Trump styled dialogues. It’s not prohibited, it’s just… not recommended. Hence, my whole idea of marriage was pursued as a method of immigration. I can’t say I was ever used to such assumptions, but I managed to grow pretty thick skin. I must admit, some parts of me wanted to yell that this is ridiculous, it could be so much simpler to carry on living on working visa without extra headache or extra fees. I wanted to shout that they were all wrong. Instead, I sniggered and left the room of intoxication.<br><br>

				____<br><br>

				I was finally ready to send the invitations to my acquaintances. I’d never been more excited to plan their trips to the UK and, to be fair, I’d never been more excited to receive big doses of attention. As my best friends started to call me five seconds after the proposal, I needed a new outbreak of loud, cheerful “congratulations”.</p>

					After weeks of moral preparation, I went online and sent messages to my Russian gang. As soon as I pressed the “Send” button, the memories were overlapping one another and eventually I was dwelled into nostalgic mood. One of the guys, Igor, was the first person I sent the message to. Looking at our facebook log, I couldn’t resist laughing at his profile picture. Wearing a sparkly metallic jacket, he held a cigarette in the most elegant way pretending to be David Bowie. In reality, he looked like Peter Doherty at his worst. My other message went to my friend Nick who was one of the interesting types. During our school graduation party, his girlfriend cheated on him with his classmate. Instead of making a scene, he took his scarf, his money, a bottle of whiskey and disappeared. He returned home two weeks later with a lady named Natali, who became his wife three years later. Classy. Finally, I shared my news with Pete - a stunning man whose inspiration was Barney Stinson. I have no idea why we were friends.</p>

						I was interrupted by the annoying sound of Facebook notification that I always forget to turn off. Pete wrote me! How exciting!<br><br>

						“Woah! Are you getting married? Seriously?”<br><br>

						Ten seconds later.<br><br>

						“I’m very shocked, if I’m honest! Very, very shocked. How could YOU put chains of marriage? I love you guys, but MARRIAGE. What if you want to sleep with other people? Not a very smart move”.<br><br>

						I’ve always appreciated honesty. I’m very straightforward myself and I have always seen why it tends to challenge people. I was challenged indeed. There were two solutions: either I jump into his trap and continue the dialogue or just ignore it for a day or two. Before I could make this decision, I got messages from other people.<br><br>

						“Cool. So, what about feminism? How can you be both, a feminist and a wife?” - Nick.<br><br>

						“No way, we haven’t even kissed yet! You can’t get married now! No, no, no!” - Igor.<br><br>
						----<br><br>
						My first impulse was getting a fag. Then, one more. Unfortunately, cigarettes are not solving mind-blowing and disgusting confrontations, but the calming effect is undeniable.I obviously wanted to write back asking “What happened guys we were friends. We had our own punk band! Do you remember we played PJ Harvey’s “Man-Sized” at my place with the frying pans and steel spoons? Do you remember singing Heroes after 50 hours of partying? Do you remember us graduating with A+ and laughing about the irony of life?” Then I realised...they did remember. <br><br>

						It’s easy to notice the development of your own personality over the years. Usually, it starts with the acceptance that vegetables do have some taste and then you want a new washing machine for your birthday. But to be serious, it’s fairly onerous to accept that your friends from the past are adults now even if they matured rapidly in only a year. It happens. We tend to remind ourselves of all the silly situations we’ve been together - from running naked at 6am to googling the tutorial videos in order to open a tuna can. And I’m not an exception here. I haven’t seen Igor, Pete or Nick for a few years and the first memories that came to my head were full of joyful, silly and extravagant days.<br><br>

						Did they remember a drunker version of myself being carried in a trolley? Or did they laugh about my inability to commit to anyone who ever called me “baby”?<br><br>
