            I was inside a rather upscale building, sitting on a fancy chair which function was limited to aesthetical purpose only. Honestly, it was hard as a rock. Hypochondriac inside me had already booked an appointment with a GP regarding a possible hemorrhoid. Anyway, I was trying not to think too much and to concentrate on my professional look: straight back, confidence-striking eyes. I was waiting for the job interview. My first job interview.<br><br>

            My already-have-a-career-friends never stop advising to be myself and show off “the perfect cocktail of friendliness, expertise and likeability”- to the notice, that is already enough for not being myself.  I’m awkward and clumsy. I’m also not really good with first impressions. And don’t let me start with professionalism, I look like 13 even with some make-up on.<br><br>

            To my surprise, the interview did not stink as much as my armpits after (stress, people?). Though it wasn’t successful either. I smiled, I nodded, I pretended to be almost-ideal and discussed my experience along with the ambitions. The questions were not monotonous and were not read from the insipid script (let’s agree, “what is your weakness” and “how do you see yourself in five years” are annoyingly useless), instead, I was asked about my life story. ”Why did you decide to move to the UK?” Being caught up in a very moment I answered this question with no shame and fear, “How could I be away from the country that produced “Common People?”. The dry smiles of the employees drastically affected my eager desire to promulgate myself. Not to be further disappointed, I swallowed my embarrassment and carried on answering less honestly.</p>

            I hate this question. Mainly to the reason, that I wasn’t lying and the fascination by British culture, particularly by music and cinema, played the crucial role in my life. I also had a British ex-boyfriend who left our romance to be continued. How could I stay at home not giving my heart one more chance to be happy? My curiosity was pushing me out of the limits and it developed enough impact to leave my dearest friends and encounter the maximum of courage to move out. You might assume that I am silly, but I prefer to be called adventurous.<br><br>

            I must admit, I had other less eccentric reasons to live in England. It’s obvious: there is better education and better job opportunities. In my head, things were much easier abroad and I would be finally appreciated. I never cared to research the job market or find any Russians who achieved fantastic prospects and worked legally in London. I was relying on my ambiguous intuition and naive hopes. Despite the striking reality, I had been studying at the university and demolishing the negative thoughts or worries about my future. “I got out, I’m abroad, I’m succeeding,” I kept whispering after the numberless essay submission.<br><br>

            Frankly speaking, my life seemed flawless and clueless at the same time. I knew I'd be working in media, I'd become influential and assertive. I dreamt I would portray the image for young women to be striving for. Yet, nothing seemed to be coming out well.  I was walking home from a very first job interview and my career perspectives were rather faltering.<br><br>

            Graduating is hard enough. Facing the changing environment, evolving future (though you are not really sure what it is evolving to) can frighten anyone. Some people move back to their parents' houses, someone applies for MA, someone's already got a job which she/he is not enjoying to a moderate extent. I've always thought I was one of those people whose talents would bring the results into their hands - a very immature tactic to have, especially for a recent graduate. My problem is not that I write hideous or unbecoming stories or that my imagination is facing a blind alley. It’s not even completely troublesome that I’m dubious about my career options. The smarting drawback is overthinking.<br><br>

            I am proficient at many skills but overthinking could get me a first prize in “make a mountain out of a molehill” competition. It never helped me in my personal life (“he said he hates Kubrick yet my Facebook shows most of his films as my favorites… is he pointing out my bad taste or what?”) and apparently it prevented me to progress professionally (“Was that PULP’s song reference too elitist? What if hiring managers hate Britpop?”). Drowning in your own worries and assumptions does not lead a healthy route into success. In contrary, I spent more time on thinking about an aim rather than achieving it. Besides, I spent way too much time analyzing my answers and my inner individual.<br><br>

            My boyfriend once told me that I should have accepted a previous job offer, a Scheduling Assistant, instead of claiming how boring my daily routine would become. Meticulously managing the calendars and Excel was not good enough for me. Neither was the position within the operations department. I kept on rejecting opportunities simultaneously concentrating on finding my inner predispositions to something beautiful.

            Now I’m looking back and shaking my head. No career-striking opportunities missed, yet I spent my spare time in bed. Such daily routine not only exhausts you mentally (layering a path to insanity, too) but does not inspire, it simply does not feed your head. Lots of people are dreaming of expressing themselves creatively and I’m not an exception to this rule. However, no creativity can be found in between four walls or on route to your local grocery store/ university/ boyfriend’s place. It’s never found in your routine unless you are a genius who can bring a poetical sanctity by looking at the unwashed dishes. Creativity is pitiless and merciless. To be satisfied, you ought to repeat after me: get out of your comfort zone.<br><br>

            This is not a motivation to take on a job in the chip shop neither an invitation to go out every night. In reality, it’s a discipline to learn: you have to embrace your insecurities and try new things. Who knows, maybe you have never heard of –that-ubiquitous-rock-band, go and get a cd, write down your thoughts about it. Or perhaps, you are afraid of being alone all day, why not trying a hiking day out of the buzzy city. There are millions books to read, numberless places to visit, limitless experiences to try out. The major key is a regulation of your own time: keeping yourself busy and productive (yes, you are still applying for jobs). One friend of mine managed to attend the same exhibition opening as his potential (now, actual) employer and the job interview leaded into the best catch-up of all recruitment stories. Investigate and haunt the new hobbies especially if you are feeling skeptical about something specific at first, it’s a great chance to prove how wrong or right you are.<br><br>

            Yes, you will be failing. That’s one of the most vital lessons such attitude will bring. You will be failing constantly and you will desperately hate yourself for not working harder. Fortunately, here goes the best part: you will also develop drastically. Once, I took a job with a famous TV-Channel to work under a copywriting department. I didn’t last longer than two days due to the negative and miserable work environment and political propaganda that surreptitiously slipped through any conversation I held within a building. Men were calling me “that breasty girl” and my boss compared me to the jar of pickles (there was a joke behind it which I don’t remember or don’t want to remember). I can’t say I failed by getting myself out of it (arguably, I did fail career-wise) but I had one of the most obscure yet funniest job practices. That’s enough for creative inspiration because it’s better to be an individual with 2 days experience than a person who neglects a chance. Be risky, be interesting.<br><br>

            Since my first job interview I undertook taekwondo classes, improved my British accent, bought a new film camera, learnt how to use Adobe Creative Suit and wrote fifteen essays. I never thought of myself to be interested in football but I spent weeks catching up on local games. I started to read about the environment and “This Changes Everything” literally CHANGED EVERYTHING in my head. Being rejected from job applications started to hurt less because I was too busy evolving and growing up.

            And here I am, inside an upbeat, extremely lively and loud office with very comfortable chairs. I can see other candidates and we share awkward but in my case extremely genuine smiles. This position is not as exciting as my dreams were at the university, you see, it’s not a Discovery office. Moreover, it is a job that involves enormous level of energy and hard work. I would have never applied to this job before and obviously I wouldn’t be invited to the interview either. But I have a good feeling about it now. Still, at this point, I am hundred percent sure that there will be other cute clumsy references to my music and cinema tastes and yet I am nonchalant. My method is aimed to show off my diverse and enthralling self. Because I’m so much better than I was three months ago.
