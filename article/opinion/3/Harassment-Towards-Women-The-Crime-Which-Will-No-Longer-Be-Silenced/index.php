  <h1 class="articleActual_point">One lone voice can give courage to thousands</h1>
  <p>If we have learned anything from the recent reports of sexual misconduct against women coming out of Hollywood, the European Union and political circles here in Great Britain as well as the United States no crime goes unpunished. The silence which has commonly surrounded these incidents of violence have started to unravel into an unstoppable domino effect.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Societies’ so-called evolution is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide a far darker reality than any of us could have ever imagined</h1>
  <p>Being given the right to work was truly a milestone to thousands of women. Nevertheless, having the right to do it safely is far from being an accomplished. Sadly, for many women, this is a harsh reality so many have had to live with on a daily basis. Make no mistake it doesn’t mean they’re okay with it, but as it is with everything else, putting up with the risks of physical harm and decimation is the price to pay for survival. After all, money indeed makes the world go round.</p><br>
  <p>Much of western society has come a long way in ensuring that women are no longer barred from performing tasks because of their sex which has ultimately resulted in billions of women from all walks of life joining the workforce. Thus, putting an end to the unfortunate occurrence of women having to depend on men for financial support.</p><br>
  <p>Nevertheless between the lines lies a lot of a grey area which for the most part translate into unspoken rules which are highly discriminatory towards well. These rules are far from echoing a normalcy which so many of modern society has tried to project, such as the implantation of specific tasks which are developed precisely for women.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Gender-based jobs? What’s that?</h1>
  <p>Over the decade's so many women have not only started to support their families. But doing so has enabled them to establish professional careers have which have allowed so many to become the primary breadwinners. Ultimately putting an end to a high dependency on men for support</p><br>

  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Having to put up with disrespect and at time brutal attacks weren't in the job description</h1>
  <p>Times have changed at least on paper. Nonetheless, so many individuals, “male superiors” are still stuck in the mindset of women taking the role of the “weaker sex.” Nevertheless, instead of taking the high road of being gentlemen and treating women as equals. So many men have taken advantage of their positions of power by creating highly volatile situations for women who are vulnerable due to the need of earning a living.</p><br>
  <p>This type of backward discriminatory, sexist outlook on life has undoubtedly led so many women to question societies’ so-called “modernisation.” Isn’t the key to progress the ability to maintain a sense of workplace professionalism? Which sadly is a concept, so many men continue to be unable to grasp.</p><br>
  <p>This unwillingness to change minds and attitudes is the reason so many women continue to be vulnerable to occurrences of workplace violence. These unfortunate incidents are far from only one dimensional. They can take on many forms such as verbal, emotional, physical and sexual harassment. Despite the type of harassment and violence dished out the aftermath is equally traumatic.</p><br>

  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Silence truly is the loudest cry</h1>
  <p>For individuals who have never been victim to any form harassment, it’s pretty simple to say that once incidents happen they should be promptly reported. Not doing so often results in developing a suspicion to the seriousness of the crimes and their validity. However, one fact that is frequently ignored is that due to the traumatic effects of these events, telling someone about it is easier said than done.</p><br>
  <p>It’s hard to listen to a news broadcast these days without hearing about another woman speak out that she is a victim of an assault at the hands of a male supervisor or co-worker. More often than not one familiar pattern which continually takes shape is that the main perpetrators tend to be men who are in positions of power. This fact explains the motives behind these crimes of abuse, an abuse of power because they can.</p><br>
  <p>Thus, despite the victim’s courage to speak out about the incident, they are often confronted with more questions which can echo the undertones of suspicions rather than the natural response of comfort. If not phrased correctly could quickly take the form of, “victim blaming.”</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">If it can’t be seen, it doesn’t exist</h1>
  <p>For decades sweeping these incidents under the rug was done without a second thought. Often disguised as protecting the privacy of the individual. But, in reality, it was to maintain the reputation of the perpetrator who had come to represent the company. If these scandalous incidents were brought into the light, well let’s just say it could indeed mean the immediate downfall of the corporation’s reputation.</p><br>
  <p>If the higher-ups in corporate offices were honest with themselves this in itself is the reason for the cover-ups, MONEY TALKS! That’s the ugly truth behind the hiding and lies. Thus, a combination of a wealthy man in power combined with the ability to take the companies money with him can further tighten the gag order on so many victims.</p><br>
  <p>Maintaining a sense of impartiality is impossible to continue when suddenly it comes to light that these women are no longer nameless victims in a crowd. Suddenly, the reality is far too difficult to ignore when each of these women has a face and a name. They are no longer a statistic, but someone’s wife, daughter, mother and friend.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">As with all things power ultimately comes to an end</h1>
  <p>It’s one thing to read about the definition of violence of any kind against women which can enable the development of a feeling of indifference.</p><br>
  <p>Below are accounts of real victims who have courageously decided to speak out so that once and for all the perpetrators of these despicable crimes will be forced to pay. So to hell with reputations of those so-called superiors and HR representatives. They should thought of that before deciding to carry out these crimes and sweep them under the rug.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Please note:<br>
  The identities of the individuals behind these testimonials have been kept entirely anonymous due to the fact that some of them are still forced to work at in these hostile environments. Thus, revealing themselves could mean disastrous for their physical safety.<br>
  Modern work environments a ruse for inequality</h1>
  <p>“I was excited to be a part of a liberal modern group that sees the world in the contemporary and fresh vision.” After all shouldn’t this mean their views on society are modernised as well? Thus, equal rights for both men and women?</p><br>
  <p>Nevertheless, it wasn’t long before the false vibe would come to an end.</p><br>
  <p>“During meetings with the senior staff (all male), I started to experience all sorts of ageist jokes (I look very young). When they found out that I was only 25, one of the managers said ‘I had a mistress that young – so refreshing.”</p><br>
  <p>Remarks such as these should hardly be taken flippantly. There is nothing one dimensional about them on the contrary they are a common tactic predators use to groom their victims. A way of testing the waters per say, as too see how far they can go.</p><br>
  <p>Clearly, through the eyes of the victim, there is nothing that could constitute these comments as being “ok.” Nevertheless, due to her young appearance and vulnerability of being the only woman present in a room of men the abuse of power began.</p><br>
  <p>Without a doubt, her male superiors knew perfectly well that their comments were sexualised and highly inappropriate. Thus, it was blatantly apparent that they were making her feel uncomfortable.</p><br>
  <p>“We are sexualised and seen as ‘below staff’ constantly.” So her being a woman somehow made this behaviour ok? That’s the morphed viewpoint most male superiors guilty of offences more often than not seem to take.</p><br>
  <p>“I started to report verbal harassment on the same day of the harassment to take place. Usually, I was told by HR to ‘relax, forget about it.’ I got sympathised looks, but then they explained that these men belong in the different generation and I should ignore it.”</p><br>
  <p>I wasn’t aware that a generation gap would constitute this treatment as being acceptable. Once again a corporation that is more interested in saving face rather than the welfare of their female employees. After the unthinkable would be soiling the reputations of the male counterparts.</p><br>
  <p>Would someone care to explain how this type of behaviour can bring on progress?</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Nothing’s sacred anymore when even holiday parties wouldn’t constitute a safe space</h1>
  <p>“Christmas party 2015. My friend and I were the only attending females. My boss dressed up as Santa. He and his colleagues were drinking and laughing. Eventually, the time came to the exchange of gifts. All “boys” did the simple exchange from hands to hands, but when it was my turn, the ‘Santa’ insisted on my sitting on his lap. Everyone cheered. He touched my breast.” It clearly wasn’t all fun and games for everyone involved.<br><br>
  One fact is evident for the most part men are larger in stature than women. The truth is, and there’s nothing that can be done to curve this reality ultimately. That being said, one of the first things any woman learns in life is not to put herself in vulnerable situations.</p><br>

  <h1 class="articleActual_point">It’s not always the stranger on the poorly lit deserted road</h1>
  <p>Studies have shown that most attacks are committed by someone known to the victim. One of the main advantages these attackers have is the amount of trust already established between the perpetrator of the crime and the victim. After all, what woman in her right mind would take a job, with the mindset that the occurrence of any harassment would be inevitable. Who enters a position with that mentality?</p><br>
  <p>One of the most common phrases regularly reiterated by superiors and HR representatives is the importance of maintaining a non-toxic workplace. Since only by doing so will a productive environment based on trust be promoted.</p><br>
  <p>If what is said on company policy manuals indeed echoes the views of HR and other higher-ups in the corporate ladder. Then inevitably, anyone would expect their reaction of sympathy when confronted by a victim of abuse. After all, she was surrounded, frightened, dominated and highly vulnerable.</p><br>
  <p>This situation should have gone against the HR staff’s sensibilities. A female co-worker was apparently sexually assaulted, that isn’t acceptable by anyone’s standards.
  At least that’s how HR should have reacted, but sadly the reality was in stellar contrast to anything most of us would qualify as a typical perception of the events.</p><br>
  <p>“On the next day, I went straight to HR. I was told that it was a drunk event with loads of fun and I shouldn’t take it seriously.”</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">She was sexually assaulted. What part of the event shouldn’t she have taken seriously?</h1>
  <p>One thing is for sure those policy rules and regulations regarding a safe work environment for all employees, applies to everyone unless that person happens to be a woman who finds herself in a vulnerable position she just can’t get out off. For the simple fact that the perpetrators of these despicable crimes turn out to be superiors as everyone knows these economic times are hard for everyone. Jobs of any kind are not so easy to come by. That being said once employment is found one does what one can to hang onto the post.</p><br>
  <p>“I didn’t come to the press or anyone else regarding the issue at the Christmas party – to me; it was the questions of ‘what’s the point?’ I couldn’t afford to lose my job; I am a single mother who rents a 1800pm apartment, I pay for the nursing, etc. etc. I shut up to survive.”</p><br>
  <p>As is illustrated the worse part of these incidents is that most women who are targeted are genuinely the most vulnerable. Even though any woman can fall victim to these incidents, superiors tend to focus on single mothers, those really in need of a job.</p><br>
  <p>It into question her superiors state of mind as he carried out this heinous act. This woman’s boss obviously was not as drunk as HR made him out to be. That statement given to the victim was a cover-up nothing more. Her superior was lucid enough to realise that because of her financial situation and lack of any other support the chances of the incident being reported were slim.</p><br>
  <p>After all fear of termination could always be held over her head. The fact that he was her superior significantly increased the chances of him getting away with it.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Who knew so much danger could linger in mingling? Anything innocent can be turned into something malicious by those in power with dark intentions.</h1>
  <p>“It happened during the corporate party seven years ago. Everyone was drinking and playing games. Basically, it was tonnes of fun. My boss and I were very friendly, and I never felt unsafe. When the party was over, my manager and I stayed in my office, and we continued to ‘mingle’ and remember the funny parts about our jobs, clients. Generally, we talked about work. It was great fun. We were friends. He knew I had a husband and a daughter; I knew he had a wife and three kids. It was a safe environment, and I would never feel that, according to many people that tend to blame the victim, ‘I was asking for it’ – it wasn’t the case.”</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Once again this seemingly innocent situation would take an ugly turn for the worst.</h1>
  <p>“We were talking about work, and then he stood up and put his hands on my waist. I said: ‘Peter, stop trying to be funny’ and laughed.”</p><br>
  <p>This type of reaction is obviously one of shock. After all, this can’t be happening? They’re friends she trusted him.</p><br>
  <p>“Then he put up my skirt. Then, I freaked out; I was trying to get out of there. He literally jumped me so that I could fall on the sofa; then he started ‘dry hamping’ me.” It was evident that her superior’s true intentions came to light in a matter of minutes.
  Could we be coming to the dark realisation that females cannot even develop friendships with their male co-workers or superiors? Whether we like it or not cautiousness should be applied to even the most innocent of situations.</p><br>
  <p>Despite the seriousness of the offence which could only be described as attempted rape. The HR representatives of the corporation who were hired to prioritise the employee’s well-being above anything else. They ended up threatening her with a lawsuit. Which sadly ended in a termination.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Clever scams dressed up as highly prestigious positions</h2>
  <p>One of the most sought out jobs from across the pond in America is any employment opportunities within the federal government. But, sadly because of the red tape and nepotism surrounding the selection process of potential candidates, most will not get the exact position they want on the first try.</p><br>
  <p>That being said most candidates who were not fortunate enough to be shortlisted end up trying to get a foot in the door through the utilisation of contract positions. Unfortunately, these jobs not only come with a much lower pay grade but an astounding increase in the vulnerability of female employees.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Shouldn’t these positions come with a greater sense of security?</h2>
  <p>The reality is quite the opposite. Even though the offences committed were far from any sexual contact given the amount of security in place, they are none the less highly inappropriate.
  Superiors both on the government and contractor side have been accused of openly making inappropriate comments towards female workers. Thus, implying that sexual encounters between themselves and female co-workers have already taken place.</p><br>
  <p>These occurrences are not only humiliating for the victims but can severely tarnish their reputations. For the most part, superiors who have made those comments will more often than not get away with them scot-free.</p><br>
  <p>Now just because the sexual incidents weren’t physical doesn’t mean that bodily didn't occur. Some male superiors have taken to getting far too close to multiple females so much so that it could best be described as getting within their personal space.</p><br>
  <p>Just when we thought it couldn’t get any worse physical battery ultimately occurred in the form of large file folders containing sharp loose staples being thrown at females by their male superiors. But, heavy and sharp it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that these actions would ultimately result in severe injuries.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">What could be the motivation for sweeping these incidents under the rug?</h2>
  <p>The harsh reality is that money talks. That’s pretty much all I takes to keep a corporation running. Suddenly the welcoming faces and friendly greetings slip away, and the façade is dropped. Workers, females, in particular, are seen as highly replaceable.</p><br>
  <p>This fact is illustrated by the lower pay grades women have to settle for and the so-called, “suitable positions.” Such as assigning women to desk work while men are given tasks that would require a lot more physical activity.</p><br>
  <p>With that being said the reasons, behind giving excuses for these incidents is quite apparent, female workers are not viewed as valuable. So, clearly in the eyes of most corporations incidents such as these could risk their skeletons being let out of the closet, and it just isn’t worth it.</p><br>
  <p>“Why take the risk because of a traumatised female?” That question is the disgusting yet reality behind the cover-ups. These types of injustice continue to occur despite the fact that some HR representatives are women as well. That factor doesn’t matter since they are all in on it, which if sifted through can result in injustice for countless women.</p><br>
  <p>Don’t be afraid to speak out. Living in silence is just the same as allowing the perpetrators to assert more control. Isn’t it time victims take their control back?</p><br>
  <p>It’s highly evident through the countless daily reports of physical, sexual, verbal and mental abuse women have had to endure for years. There is no such thing as the perfect crime and misdeeds of men in power will always come back to haunt them.</p><br>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">Prevention truly is the key</h1>
  <p>One of the reasons why these crimes against women are so ramped is because the silence surrounding them decreases the chances of reports being filed. More and more victims are continually being driven into silence because of the ever shadowing blanket of shame.</p><br>

  </div>
  <h1 class="articleActual_point">We can’t fix it if we don't talk about it</h1>
  <p>An openness that’s the key because unless a sense of trust is established more victims will continue to live in silence. So, instead of living in denial others must be encouraged to speak up.</p><br>
  <p>A lone voice speaking out can start an avalanche of thousands which aren’t that easily ignored. Only then will justice indeed be served.</p> <br>
