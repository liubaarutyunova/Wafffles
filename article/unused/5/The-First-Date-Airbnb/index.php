    Thirty-eight reindeer look down at us. From paintings, cups, pillows and clocks, the inanimate eyes watch as we meet for the first time in person. The air is very awkward. If the reindeer could cringe I’m sure they would.</p>
    <p>This is our flat for our weekend trip. This is in Hamburg, Germany. This is also a Tinder date.</p>
    <p>A couple months prior, I thought it was just another match destined to go stale. I am an American expat living in Prague, while he was Swedish just traveling through. However, after a day of talking and smiling stupidly at my phone our conversation didn’t end.</p>
    <p>We had the components of tech-chemistry: similar humor, sarcasm and usage of GIF’s of course. We never had to chance to meet in person as he traveled back to Sweden the day we matched. But I began to build up a sense of connection as we talked about each other’s days, picked each other’s brains and said our good morning’s and goodnight’s. After he confirmed a height that exceeded my 5’8” (god bless the Nordic genes), I was willing to invest some time in this.</p>
    <p>I used to be a hopeless romantic, my mind in constant scenarios of meeting “the one” in endless scenarios. But that was when I was younger and unaware of the impending popularity of online dating. I am now a single twenty-something navigating the era of Tinder with a skeptical swiping finger. The lack of voice, mannerisms and composure, all very real aspects of attraction, leave me wondering with judgmental assumptions, inventive wonderings and drifting hopes.</p>
    <p>To quell some of this imagination (and the tiny concern he was catfishing me), we tried a video chat. The same bearded face from the photos came on the screen (whew) with a rather cute voice, thanks to the Swedish accent. It felt somewhat normal talking over the phone. It even became normal to talk on the phone for over an hour and message throughout the days.</p>
    <p>Eventually after a month, the digital obsession had to end. Either we met in person, or I cut the Wi-Fi cord stringing from Prague to Malmö. I already had a trip planned for myself to Hamburg, Germany the next month. This happens to be close to Sweden. This was our chance.</p>
    <p>We proposed our plans with hesitated questions like hopeful middle schoolers, each of us not wanting to sound too forward or ludicrous. “Maybe I could take the bus to meet you in Hamburg?!” “Maybe we should just stay together in an Airbnb?!” “Maybe we will just share the bed?!”</p>
    <p>Sexual attraction of course played a part in this rendezvous. It was Tinder after all. While it may have been the exotic Euro-appeal or his clever use of the disco man emoji, what actually had me holding high hopes was our level of comfort to talk freely about our sexual histories and preferences. It felt much more open and mature than what I expected from a conversation sprouting from a hookup app. While this candor built up excitement, it also built up the pressure for the sexual chemistry to click the way we expected. Just like ordering a shirt online, you never really know if it works until you try it in person.</p>
    <p>The time came for me to board the flight to Hamburg. Both the planning and the risks suddenly felt very real. I was either going to end up a) having a perfectly fun and slightly R-rated weekend, b) having a super awkward and regrettable weekend, or c) gagged at the bottom of the North Sea. Well, my chances for bondage were pretty high at least.</p>
    <p>When I arrived at the Airbnb, he came down to greet me. The first wave of anxiety released. He was not fronting for a middle-aged axe murderer without teeth, as I had slightly feared. He was the young bearded Swede in all black that I expected. The second half of the anxiety left since the promised height held true.</p>
    <p>A nervous wave took over the air between us. This was our first time meeting, yet we knew so much about each other. Up the stairs I tried to make small talk to break the titanium shielded ice but was cut short when the door opened. While the walls slapped your eyes with the limiest of greens, that wasn’t what we were looking at.</p>
    <p>The place was completely covered in reindeer. All shapes and forms, they adorned the bedroom to the kitchen and even the bathroom. Reindeer paintings, reindeer clocks, you name it and it had a furry creature on it. One morning we counted and had to forfeit at 38. Whatever this woman was on clearly gave her hallucinations the zombie apocalypse could only be fought with antlers.</p>

    <p>Great. I was stuck in a flat with a guy I kind of just met in a city I don’t know with animals staring at me while I pee. I suggested beer and he nodded swiftly. At a bar nearby, minutes of chatting cleared the way for a familiarity to sink in. Our conversation proved just as easy and fun as it was online. I then began to discover traits previously invisible to me. He gestured a lot with hands. He scratched his beard often. And he moved with a slightly self-conscious slump of a hipster.</p>
    <p>The man in my mind meshed with this physical form in front of me, and I found I liked him. It felt natural as we walked back to our flat. It felt natural as he kissed me for the first time in the room of reindeer. And, when I was 100% sure he wasn’t an axe murderer, it felt natural for things to progress.</p>

    <p>Sleeping with him did not feel like a one night (or weekend) stand. Oddly enough, the past few months of talking online really did make it feel like I knew him. Maybe I didn’t know his idiosyncrasies just yet. But the abstract connection built from our consistent conversation became tangible the night we slept together. He suddenly felt like a real person I knew.</p>

    <p>We explored Hamburg with the same attitude that brought us here: spontaneity, curiosity and an open mind. The cozy neighborhoods and vibrant creative community formed a rather romantic atmosphere. However, the port city’s blocky freights and sex shows provided a faintly mocking reminder we were not in a “city of love” for traditional romantic escapes. We were in a “city of ports” for erratic sexual escapades.</p>

    <p>Admittedly, everything was not all Before Sunrise. He got on my nerves. Never contributing to the day’s plans, he would always want to just “go with the flow,” leaving me with all the decision-making. He added “…as fuck” to every adjective out his mouth. And he constantly walked with his arm around me to an obstructive degree.</p>

    <p>While these actions irked me, they stirred the actual irritation that brewed in the back of my mind. This trip forced us to act like a real couple. We shared a bed; we made each other coffee; we walked side by side in silence down the street. Never having been in a long-term relationship myself, going through these motions befuddled me. I played along with this little game of house in exchange for a nice companion, but it seemed our dalliance weekend edged too far into a dating weekend. While we both knew how to play our part, neither one of us knew if we actually wanted to.</p>

    <p>On the final night, loitering in a children’s playground with a bottle of wine, the hipsters of the neighborhood bustled around us. As we talked we came to the inevitable dead-end of “what next?” I liked him as a person and a friend, yet our make-believe relationship left me confused. I wasn’t sure I saw him as a partner. I needed more time with him to know. And I needed more time with him in person. He understood my uncertainty and kept a hopeful attitude of “you never know.” Sweden and Czech Republic aren’t too far apart.</p>

    <p>After arriving back in Prague, I sat in my flat attempting to get my head around the previous days. I planned a weekend trip with a Tinder match. While I slightly judged myself on the brash trust I gave to someone I met online, I justified this trip in equal parts hope, optimism and naiveté in pursuing a connection I had good feelings about. This impulsive romance fed my adventurous side, the side that slyly taunts my sensible side with a half-smile waving life experience in the air like a dog treat.</p>

    <p>One night we were observing the passing German crowds over a beer when he wondered, “Isn’t it nice to be excited about life?” I blanked, my only response a nod in agreement because he was right.</p>

    <p>I went to Hamburg to embrace the excitement of the present, not to meet a boy I would worry about being my boyfriend. This zealous outlook led me to explore new places with new people, all from a swipe of a finger.</p>

    <p>What if we were all as excited about life as that flat owner was excited about reindeer? Life would be a hell of a lot more fun.</p>

    <p>But then again, maybe a bit creepier too.</p>
